# DiscordMusicBotProject
Alternative music bot since YT is taking free open source ones down.

A simple music bot designed in discord.py(python) uysing youtube-dl.

This app can be setup to have uptime by repl into a webserver, this is done with keep_alive found in the project. 

We then can use uptimerobot to monitor the service by using the keep_alive script URL output as our monitoring URL. 

This during testing for 3 days (72 hrs) had 100% uptime.
